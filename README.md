## From Tanya to You ;) -->
Hope you enjoy using noted! I worked REALLY hard on it. Working with PyQT5 without using a Designer is tough but I made it work. 

I will in the future try to implement:
* Open existing md files and edit them in noted.
* Adding WYSIWYG features.
* Spell checking
* Improved Markdown rendering.
* Improve translucency effect
* More THEMES! :)
